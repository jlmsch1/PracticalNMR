    "I prefer a ${cos}^2(x)$ function for killing wiggles. Sometimes, that's the most important thing - like in a 2D. You can see that the resolution does suffer. You can go for a bigger value of SSB (e.g. > 3) and get a shifted cos function instead. Some of the resolution will come back, but at the expense of growing, negative lobes on either side of your peak.\n",

Go back up to _Task 6_ and compare SSB = 2 versus SSB = 20. When SSB = 2, you have a cos function, the first point starts at 1, and the first point of the FID is scaled by 1 (no change!). When SSB = 20, you have a sin function, the first point starts at 0 (nearly), and the first point of the FID is scaled by 0. If the first data point is 0, then the integral must also be 0! The only way to make that happen is to have half of the peak > 0 and half of the peak < 0."
